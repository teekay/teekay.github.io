      <h1><a name="upcoming"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Milonga on August 17</h1>
      <p>We are on this Saturday with me spinning the decks. I'll continue exploring the 1950s while stepping back and forth in time as necessary to keep a good flow. Chances of electro: slim, however modern acoustic ensembles will be heard.</p>

      <h1><a name="Aug10"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Milonga on August 10</h1>
      <p>DJ Vláďa continues this Saturday with another great playlist from the Golden Age, peppered with the occasional foray into newer music.</p>  
      <p>The weather report indicates it should not rain tomorrow evening, plus it won't be as hot as it was last time. See you there!</p>

      
      <h1><a name="Aug3"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Milonga on August 3</h1>
      <p>DJ Vláďa returns to stage with a great traditional playlist. When asked to describe he told me it's "the best of Golden Age with the occasional outreach to the 1950s and less occasional outreach to the more recent years". Not to be missed!</p>
      <p>As special guests we will have Amanda & Elise dance for us, the awaited Duo Feminino. As we've had a slight deficit of men in the last few milongas I have a gut feeling that this performance will restore parity, if not bring more  men than women for a change.</p>  
      
      <h1><a name="outage" class="anchor" href="#outage"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>No milonga on July 27</h1>
      <p>We are taking a break this Saturday as the space will be used for a different purpose. We will return on Saturday, August 3, with a traditional playlist and a midnight show by <a href="http://www.buenosairestango.cz/cs/akce_cs/workshop-s-elise-amandou">Duo Feminino</a>.</p>
      <p>You can still dance that night, however, on <a href="http://www.tangoinprague.eu/">milonga Gröbovka</a>!</p>

<a name="milonga-on-july-20" class="anchor" href="#milonga-on-july-20"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Milonga on July 20</h1>

<p>On July 20 we will play the new "tango synthesis" playlist, the origins of which I <a href="http://tangodjnotes.com/blog/2013/7/searching-for-the-right-alt-milonga-format">explain on my blog</a>. For the newcomers, this means you will hear tangos from the Golden Age (about 50%), modern re-interpretations of the classic songs (25%) as well as neo/electro/non-tango (25%).</p>
